Redux Redux

by Teratoma.tk

A Tumblr theme for those who want a custom header, background, avatar and favicon. I was going for a bootstrap-ey kind of feel. I created this for myself but though it might have a broader appeal.
Header: Best at 982px wide.
Background: Best at 1080px tall. The theme is set to tile horizontally, fixed.
Avatar: Best at 210px X 210px - it stretches or compresses to that size.
favicon: 16X16
Based on the Tumblr theme Redux, originally created by http://jacob.tumblr.com and "Redux Edit", from themes.edada.ms
