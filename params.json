I was going for a bootstrap-ey kind of feel. I created this for myself but though it might have a broader appeal.\r\nHeader: Best at 982px wide.\r\nBackground: Best at 1080px tall. The theme is set to tile horizontally, fixed.\r\nAvatar: Best at 210px X 210px - it stretches or compresses to that size.\r\nfavicon: 16X16\r\nBased on the Tumblr theme Redux, originally created by http://jacob.tumblr.com and \"Redux Edit\", from themes.edada.ms\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
